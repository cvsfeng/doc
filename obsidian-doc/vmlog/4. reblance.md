Every `vlinsert` node spreads evenly (shards) incoming logs among `vlstorage` nodes specified in the `-storageNode` command-line flag according to the [VictoriaLogs cluster architecture](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/cluster/#architecture) . This guarantees that the data is spread evenly among `vlstorage` nodes. When new `vlstorage` nodes are added to the `-storageNode` list at `vlinsert`, then all the newly ingested logs are spread evenly among old and new `vlstorage` nodes, while historical data remains on the old `vlstorage` nodes. This improves data ingestion performance and querying performance for typical production workloads, since newly ingested logs are spread evenly across all the `vlstorage` nodes, while typical queries are performed over the newly ingested logs, which are already present among all the `vlstorage` nodes. This also provides the following benefits comparing to the scheme with automatic data rebalancing:
